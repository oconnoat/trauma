Samuel Beckett wrote Waiting for Godot: A Tragicomedy in Two Acts in a flourish of literary productivity in 1948/9.  Beckett spent most of the 1930s traveling and living in Britain, Ireland, Germany, and France. By the time World War II reached France he was living in Paris where he established himself within Surrealist and avant-garde literary and artistic circles and started writing in French.  Distraught by the German occupation of France, Beckett and many of his friends joined The Resistance (Bair 1978: 309&319).  After participating in The Resistance for a year, his network was betrayed to the Nazis, and Beckett and his partner Suzanne Deschevaux-Dumesnil went underground for their safety (Bradby 2001: 12).  In October 1942, after two months of hiding in Paris, Beckett and Suzanne procured false papers to move to the unoccupied zone.  The couple proceeded by foot from Paris to Roussillon in Provence, where they stayed for two and a half years (Bair 1978: 318&319).   The unique aesthetics of the Provence countryside and Beckett™s experiences in Roussillon figure significantly, though rather subtly, in Waiting for Godot.  In Roussillon, war was omnipresent; it was the reason Beckett was compelled to stay in the Provencal village, and it shaped nearly all the conditions of life.  Beckett and his neighbors and friends in Roussillon listened to radio reports of the war, and he participated in late-night resistance missions (Bair 1978).  Several literary scholars argue that Beckett™s post-war writings reflect his real, rather than purely intellectual, experience of war and ﬁall the anguish of waiting for contacts in dangerous circumstances, of seeing friends betrayed, hearing of their torture and death–ﬂ 
(Bradby 2001: 13).  Beckett habitually took long walks while biding his time in Roussillon (Bair 1978: 325).  The opening stage directions of Beckett™s play announce the setting: ﬁA country road.  A tree.  Eveningﬂ (Beckett [1954] 1982: 1).  Beckett™s travelers wait, uncertain of their fate, along a road like the ones between Paris to Roussillon or like the country roads where  66Beckett passed the time waiting for the war to end.  In addition, Beckett made several direct references to Roussillon in Godot, including the unique red color of the dirt, and he named a character, ﬁBonnelly,ﬂ after a local farmer (Bradby 2001: 12&13).  As I will discuss later, Godot does not explicitly refer to war.  However, the fear, anxiety, uncertainty and waiting the play conveys are unmistakably born of his experiences during the war in Roussillon.  Before I examine productions of Godot which make claims to trauma, let us look closely at Beckett™s play in order to understand the literary script employed in the social performance of trauma.                                      Waiting for Godot: A Tragicomedy in Two Acts  Simply stated, Waiting for Godot revolutionized theater.  Several decades after directing the Actors Workshop production of Waiting for Godot in San Francisco, Herbert Blau stated, ﬁI think the hardest thing to reconstruct, now that Beckett has been deified among American theater people, particularly academics, is just how startling those plays wereﬂ (Blau cited in Bradby 2001: 97).  Perhaps the most novel element of Waiting for Godot is that it lacks a true plot.  As the title indicates, Godot is a play in two acts, yet the structure of the second repeats the first.  Instead of development, the structure of Waiting for Godot is ﬁcyclical and staticﬂ (Bradby 2001: 36).  In the first act, Estragon and Vladimir meet on a road and commence waiting for Godot to arrive.  The setting is simple; as mentioned previously, the stage directions indicate only ﬁA country road.  A tree.  Evening.ﬂ  Like clowns and music-hall performers, Vladimir and Estragon banter in the form of a ﬁcross-talk actﬂ which features interruptions, unfinished stories, double meanings, and misunderstandings (Bradby 2001: 43).  Eventually Lucky, burdened by packages and with a rope around his neck, and Pozzo, holding a whip, enter the stage.  Pozzo bosses Lucky with commands such as ﬁUp pig!ﬂ (Beckett [1954] 1982: 20).  These two couples are the main figures in the play, but they are not typical dramatic characters.  They lack reliable personal  67histories and evidence of internal life.  Bradby argues that ﬁit is best to approach each of the pairs of characters as two halves of a single theatrical dynamicﬂ (2001: 29).  Pozzo and Lucky depict an interdependent master-slave relationship while Vladimir and Estragon are cross-talk performers whose symbiotic relationship takes on many shades depending on the performance, including friends, an old married couple, or two comedians (Bradby 2001: 30).  Toward the end of Act I, a boy comes to announce that Mr. Godot will not ﬁcome this evening but surely to-morrowﬂ (Beckett [1954] 1982: 55).  In Act II, the set and the actors appear physically diminished; Pozzo is now blind.  As the play ends, Vladimir and Estragon discuss committing suicide but decide to wait to see if Godot will come tomorrow.  In their last exchange, they decide to go, yet the stage direction reads, ﬁThey do not moveﬂ (Beckett [1954] 1982: 109). Typically in drama and literature, meaning is delivered via standard elements such as the progression of the plot, the topic of the play, and character development.  Actions happen in sequence, building toward an end and a resolution from which meaning or a lesson may be gleaned.  Static instead of progressing, Godot does not allow for meaning to be ﬁread offﬂ the plot (Bradby 2001: 24).  Godot also evades a structure of being directly ﬁaboutﬂ something; the play lacks a referent.  It has no inherent setting, time period, or message.  Ibsen™s A Doll™s House is about marriage in the 19th century. Waiting for Godot resists that sort of telling.  Characters wait on a road, but the object of their desire never arrives.  Further, it is not clear who or what ﬁGodotﬂ is.  Throughout his life, Beckett insisted that ﬁGodotﬂ was not a stand-in for God and if he ﬁknew who Godot wasﬂ he would have said so in the play (Bair 1978: 382; Schneider 1967: 55).  Although the figure of Godot is the focus of many audience members and critics, Martin Esslin argues that waiting, rather than Godot, is the subject of the play ([1961] 1980: 50).  However, it is not only about waiting in a standard sense.  Beckett™s Godot depicts on stage the  68existential experience of waiting.  One place to find a meaning offered by Godot is its presentation of the humanŠpainfully, comically humanŠexperience of time.  The last pairing of utterance and stage direction in the play, when the travelers decide to go yet do not move, is an example of Beckett™s treatment of the themes of movement and stasis in such a way as to unsettle meaning.  Dialogue and action work at cross-purposes, creating an effect nearly impossible to produce with prose.  This double gestureŠat once toward movement and toward stasisŠis one last destabilizing move in Godot; the end of the play, and thus the ﬁmeaningﬂ in a standard sense, is left open.  Or, perhaps, it indicates that the meaning cannot be fixed or resolved.  Beckett himself inveterately declined to illuminate the ﬁmeaningsﬂ and symbolism of his plays.  The director of the first American production who developed a personal relationship with the playwright explains that Beckett preferred to ﬁlet the supposed ‚meanings™ fall where they may–.ﬂ (Schneider 1967: 55).  As I will discuss in detail, the meanings of Waiting for Godot do not only passively ﬁfallﬂ where they may; social actors and the audience actively write meanings of their trauma into Beckett™s play.              ﬁThe play struck such different chords in its various audiences–ﬂ (Bradby 2001: 2)    Roger Blin directed the first performance of Waiting for Godot at the Théâtre de Babylone in Paris in 1953.  Beginning with that inaugural performance, critics, journalists and academics have expressed considerable interest and anxiety over whether performances of the Godot would be ﬁunderstoodﬂ and received favorably by audiences and critics.  In fact, before Blin agreed to stage Waiting for Godot at the Babylone, the play was rejected by several producers in Paris who cited concern that it was ﬁincomprehensible, boring, too highbrow, or too deepﬂ (Bair 1978: 397).  Despite the concerns, the first production in Paris proved extremely  69successful, running for four hundred performances at the Babylone before transferring to another theater in Paris (Esslin [1961] 1980: 39).   Over the course of several decades, concerns that the avant-garde qualities of the play would prevent positive audience reception of the play largely fell off.  Despite fearsŠwhich proved to be well-founded in some casesŠthat early audiences would not understand or connect with the play, Waiting for Godot has been staged extensively throughout the world.68  Its success helped propel Beckett to his position as one of the most prominent literary figures of the twentieth century, and, in turn, his literary fame conferred legitimacy on the play.  The revolutionary, avant-garde play is now a classic drama.  Although the initial anxieties that audiences would not understand or respond positively to the play subsided as it achieved the status of classic, those concerns were replaced by others.  Critics and academics now express concern that Waiting for Godot has lost its ﬁprovocative qualityﬂ and has become a ﬁsafe betﬂ to stage (Bradby 2001: 162).  However, critics, journalists, and academics have long identified performances where their anxieties about reception are much lessŠor even ceased to beŠof concern for reasons external to the logic of the theater.  When Godot was feared to be too dark or too high-brow, audiences understood it.  And when critics and academics feared Godot is merely a mundane classic emptied of its theatrical surprises, audiences felt a vibrant connection to the                                                  68 The first production in the United States was, in the words of the director, a ﬁspectacular flopﬂ (Schneider 1967: 56).  Staged in Miami, the producers advertised Waiting for Godot as the ﬁthe laugh sensation of two continentsﬂ starring the well-known comic actors Bert Lehr and Tom Ewell (Bradby 2001: 93).  Bradby assesses that Lehr and Ewell and the director doomed the production by playing up the comedic aspects of the play and making the tragic elements palatable.  Schneider, the director, attributes the production™s failure to the audience™s expectation of attending a light comedy (Schneider 1967: 56).  Due to the ﬁdisastrousﬂ run in Miami, Godot™s first opening New York City was canceled (Bradby 2001: 93).  After reorganizing the production and replacing the director and some 
of the actors, Godot opened on Broadway in April 1956 (Bradby 2001: 93).  The production in Miami is the first of several examples of Waiting for Godot failing to some degree when it was used primarily as a star vehicle or to earn large profits for the theater and production company.  A critic for The New York Times reports that the Broadway production featuring Robin Williams and Steve Martin as Vladimir and Estragon in 1988 ﬁrode into town on tidal waves of hypeﬂ (Rich 1988).  However, the show proved ﬁutterly impersonalﬂ and turned Godot into ﬁthe stage equivalent of a buddy filmﬂ (Rich 1988).  Instances of failed or less successful Godot productions underscore the interest of productions that succeed.  70play.  In the beginning of Beckett: Waiting for Godot, Bradby attributes the varied receptions of the play to variations in the logic of the theater: ﬁIt was understood (and misunderstood) differently in the different theatrical cultures (2001: 2).ﬂ  Yet, later in the book, he joins other critics and academics in acknowledging that the unique history of performances and audience reception of Waiting for Godot goes beyond the logic of the theater.  In ﬁsituations of political oppressionﬂ the canonical drama has ﬁspecial relevanceﬂ and becomes provocative once again (2001: 162).       Susan Sontag™s production of Waiting for Godot in Sarajevo during the siege in the summer of 1993 is one of the productions in ﬁsituations of political oppressionﬂ cited by Bradby.  In ﬁWaiting for Godot in Sarajevo,ﬂ Sontag articulates that the relevance and resonance of Waiting for Godot in Sarajevo was obvious.  During her first visit to Sarajevo the preceding spring, Sontag spoke with a director and producer about coming back to the city to direct a play.  When he asked which play she would direct, Sontag recalls:  And bravado, following the impulsiveness of my proposal, suggested to me in an instant what I might not have seen had I taken longer to reflect: there was one obvious play for me to direct.  Beckett™s play, written over forty years ago, seems written for, and 
about Sarajevo. (1994: 88)  
 
Why did Sontag, a social critic and literary figure with countless dramas to choose from, realize ﬁin an instantﬂ that Waiting for Godot was written for and about the situation in Sarajevo?  How is it that Godot, a play which cannot properly be said to be ﬁaboutﬂ anything, could be about the violence and suffering in that city?   In Waiting for Godot in Sarajevo: Theological Reflections on Nihilism, Tragedy, and Apocalypse, David Toole (1998) weaves together philosophy, theology, sociology, and  71contemporary politics to explain that Sontag and her audience in Sarajevo turned to Waiting for Godot as a way to reflect on the atrocities of the twentieth century.  Violence in Sarajevo book-ended the century: the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand began World War I and the citizens of Sarajevo suffered a violent siege, during which thousands died and many more suffered from malnutrition and gripping fear, at the dusk of the bloody century (Toole 1998: xiii).  Toole reflects:       I can imagine that to witness a performance of Godot in Sarajevo in 1993 would have been to meet head-on the question of what such a century might meanŠor rather, the question of whether meaning itself could possibly survive a century such as this. (Author™s emphasis 1998: 19) 
  
In Sarajevo in 1993, Waiting for Godot was not merely a classic of the theater; here the play seemed ultimately relevant to the situation.  Bradby identified the resonance and labeled it ﬁpolitical oppression.ﬂ  Recognizing the same resonance, Toole attributed the ﬁremarkable convergence of text and worldﬂ to understanding atrocity in the twentieth century (Toole 1998: 4).  In certain contextsŠvariously labeled political oppression or atrocityŠconcerns that critics, academics and journalists normally have about Godot lose their importance.  Instead of worrying whether Godot will be understood, critics and journalists reports it has ﬁstruck an instant chordﬂ with the audience (Bradby 2001: 102).  Instead of worrying about whether it has been performed too much, it seems instantly obvious to stage it and no other play (Sontag 1994: 88).  These critics identify what, in the theory of social performance and cultural pragmatics, is conceptualized as ﬁre-fusionﬂ (Alexander, Giesen and Mast 2006).  In complex, mass mediated society, social life has been ﬁde-fusedﬂ (Alexander 2006: 29).  Rituals, which rely on shared  72meanings and cultural understandings, are rare.  However, social actors in our complex social world continue to communicate the meanings of their social experiences through social performance.  Cultural pragmatics takes as its goal to demonstrate ﬁhow social performance, whether individual or collective, can be analogized systemically to theatrical onesﬂ (Alexander 2006: 29).  I argue that the theatrical performance of Waiting for Godot is a social performance in contexts of trauma.  In contexts of trauma, audiences seem to understand Godot and its deeply provocative qualities.  This ﬁre-fusionﬂ transcends the logic of the theater; audiences not only ﬁenjoyﬂ or ﬁappreciateﬂ the play, but it ﬁspeaks toﬂ and ﬁspeaks forﬂ their social situations.  In these contexts, Godot is not only a theatrical performance; it is a social performance.   Instead of the numerous explanations for fusion in these contexts, I offer one: productions of Waiting for Godot have achieved fusion in contexts of trauma.  To label these circumstances of ﬁtraumaﬂ is more than a parsimonious solution for understanding the circumstances in which Waiting for Godot is something otherŠsomething moreŠthan an avant-garde play or a classic drama.  A close study of the productions of Waiting for Godot in Sarajevo and New Orleans will contribute to our understandings of social trauma theories.  First examining these productions will help to clarify the relationship between collective trauma, a concept describing communities affected by disasters, and cultural trauma which argues that trauma is not born but made.  On the theoretical level, I will argue that collective trauma theorizes important elements of mood and emotion, but we must remain theoretically vigilant that it is not events which are traumatic but it is our construction of occurrences as traumatic to cultural structures and expectations that make 
them so.  Further, looking at productions of Waiting for Godot in Sarajevo and New Orleans will illustrate the ways in which claims to trauma through construction and narration may be made performatively rather than factually.  By staging Waiting for Godot, social actors define the  73traumaŠwhat the trauma means to the community, who are the victims, and who are the perpetratorsŠusing aesthetics and performative acts rather than evidence such as testimony, dates of events, numbers of the dead, and cost of destruction.         Trauma Theory: Mood and Meaning    Waiting for Godot has been staged in many contexts of trauma or potential trauma (Smelser 2004: 35&36); indeed, there have been too many to adequately address here.  Godot has been performed in prisons in the United States and Sweden, in Haifa with references to the plight of Palestinians in Israel, and South Africa during Apartheid by a mixed-race cast (Bradby 2001).  The very first performance of Godot at the Théâtre de Babylone followed shortly after World War II and the Nazi occupation of France.  I will discuss at length two other performances in trauma contexts: in Sarajevo during the siege and in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina.  
 Academic and clinical work on trauma began in the realm of psychiatry; Freud was the most famous early theorists of trauma (Smelser 2004: 32).  Sociologists have specified two more main types of trauma: collective (or social) trauma and cultural trauma.  Kai Erikson™s seminal study of Buffalo Creek, an Appalachian mining community almost entirely physically destroyed by a flood of mining sludge, defines and illustrates the central elements of collective trauma (1976).  Collective trauma holds as its main tenet that ﬁone can speak of traumatized 
communities as something distinct from assemblies of traumatized personsﬂ (Erikson 1995: 185).  In his précis on cultural trauma, Jeffrey Alexander acknowledges Erikson™s important contribution of conceptualizing trauma as a collective as well as individual phenomenon, but he criticizes Erikson for holding a ﬁnaturalistic perspectiveﬂ in which trauma is treated as a quality inherent in certain events due to their sudden, devastating, violent, or shocking nature (2004: 2-4).  Later in his career, Erikson seems to argue for a less-naturalistic position for collective  74trauma.  In ﬁNotes on Trauma and Community,ﬂ an essay reflecting on his decades of fieldwork and study of disasters and collective trauma, Erikson points out that his dictionary defines ﬁtraumaﬂ as a ﬁa stress or blow that may produce disordered feelings or behaviorﬂ and ﬁthe state or condition produced by such a stress or blowﬂ (1995: 184).  Erikson encourages his readers to shift their emphasis to the latter definition ﬁbecause it is how people react to them rather than what they are that give events whatever traumatic quality they can be said to haveﬂ (Author™s emphasis 1995: 184).  Cultural trauma goes further, arguing that trauma is produced when members of collectivities successfully construct and narrate an event or a series of events as significantly and indelibly undermining part or all of their culture and system of meanings (Alexander et al 2004: especially 10 & 38).  Groups make claims to injury and trauma in the ﬁtrauma processﬂ of constructing and narrating trauma between the event and its representation (Alexander 2004: 11).  It is in this process of claims-making that the production of Waiting for Godot represents, speaks for, and specifies the trauma in Sarajevo and New Orleans.    In addition to denying that traumas are born fully-formed and specified, we must also unsettle the idea of the ﬁcollectiveﬂ in collective trauma.  Collective trauma signals that a group imagined to constitute a ﬁcollectiveﬂ suffers a trauma together.  However, this ﬁcollectiveﬂ may or may not have been experienced as a community or a collective before the traumatic occurrence.  The collective trauma, therefore, can form or refigure the collectiveŠits membership, bonds, mutual responsibilities, and stance toward outsiders.  We should think of Erikson™s ﬁtraumatized communitiesﬂ as a collective that has, in a Durkheimian sense, a reality and a set of logics external to individuals.  It is this Durkheimian collective which experiences social trauma.  Erikson argues that ﬁtrauma damages the texture of communityﬂ (1995:187) in  75two ways: by damaging social bonds and by creating a social climate of trauma.  Specifying the latter sense of damage to the community, Erikson (1995) writes:  –traumatic experiences work their way so thoroughly into the grain of the affected community that they come to supply its prevailing mood and temper, dominate its imagery and its sense of self, govern the way its members relate to one another. (Emphasis added, p.190)  
 
Collective trauma is primarily a concept of emotion rather than, like cultural trauma, a concept of cognition and meaning construction.  Erikson argues against a common and rather sentimentalized vision that communities experiencing trauma enjoy a ﬁwave of good feelingﬂ when they realize that they and their community have survived the initial disaster (1995: 189).  Erikson flatly states that he has never witnessed this sort of euphoria in any of his fieldwork nor read about it in the recent literature.  Instead, collective trauma is characterized by a loss of community bonds, lack of trust in the future and in ones neighbors, and a collective mood of fear and depression (Erikson 1976).  Although we must be clear in our understanding of the concept of collective trauma and the language we use to describe it, I contend that collective trauma remains an important sociological concept for understanding when and how communities and collectives experience events as traumatic.  Collective trauma may or may not become a cultural trauma at a national or international level in a ﬁtrauma processﬂ of articulation, narration, construction, and counter-construction (Alexander et al 2004).    Erikson™s study in Buffalo Creek also indicates that collective trauma is characterized by perseveration on the traumatic occurrence.  In Buffalo Creek, residents lived in constant, illogical fear of another flood.  Many residents reported difficulty sleeping and feeling agitated and apprehensive when it rained (Erikson 1976: 179).  The occurrence is over, but the emotions stay  76with the individuals and shape the collective mood.  In other words, collective trauma involves a particular experience of time.  Days and weeks go by, but the mood of collective trauma lingers.  When performed in these situations, Waiting for Godot expresses waiting, uncertainty, anguish and fear that the people experiencing collective trauma feel acutely in their daily lives.  Like Vladimir and Estragon, individuals and collectives experiencing collective trauma do not know when their situation will end.  Nor, like Beckett™s hobos, do they know what that end will look like in terms of the bonds of community that have been forged, challenged, and upset during the occurrence and the collective trauma.   Productions of Waiting for Godot become social performance through which the collective can represent and communicate its present state to itself.  In addition, the collective may realize itself as such through a social performance of a shared emotional state and mood.  However, productions of Waiting for Godot do not become social performances expressing 
trauma on their own.  Claims to trauma do not speak for themselves.  There is a ﬁneed for walking and talkingŠand seeing and listening to the walking and talkingﬂ which theater and social performance, and theater as social performance, can provide (Alexander 2006: 33).  Social performances, like theater performances, require actors, audiences, scripts and settings.  Social actors perform and multiple audiencesŠthe in-person audience, journalists, and media 
consumersŠobserve and interpret the social performance of trauma via Waiting for Godot.  It is to these performances that I now turn.    Performing Trauma to Multiple Audiences  Beckett intended Waiting for Godot to ﬁavoid definitionﬂ (Bradby 2001: 17).  Productions of Godot honoring Beckett™s intentions could express the ﬁmood and temperﬂ of collective trauma.  However, as we will see, productions of Waiting for Godot in contexts of  77collective trauma have gone beyond mood to articulate the meaning of the situation and the identity of ﬁthe players.ﬂ  In these performances, directors, actors, journalists, and attendees inject the famously ﬁmeaninglessﬂ avant-garde play with meanings relevant to their situation.  The productions specify the victims, the perpetrators, and the meanings of the trauma itself.  The first production of Waiting for Godot provides a good example.  David Bradby (2001) reports that audiences in Paris were particularly horrified by the Pozzo-Lucky couple which was read as a Nazi-victim pair:    No doubt a sense of horror was provoked as much by the attitude of Pozzo as by the appearance and behavior of Lucky.  Memories 
of the Nazi occupation were still fresh in people™s minds.  Indeed the full horror of the death camps had emerged only gradually in 
the postwar years.  The image of a poor, broken-down slave, 
suffering from a terminal medical condition but obliged to continue to perform whatever tasks he could still manage by an arrogant master, was not very far removed from realities which were only too vivid in the memories of many in the audience. (p. 62)  
  
Bradby indicates that the director, Blin, encouraged the audience to read Pozzo as a Nazi by emphasizing the class differences between the two (Bradby 2001: 62).  Of course, the ﬁfull horrorﬂ of the death camps continued to be given meaning long after the performance of Godot in Paris.  An interesting question to poseŠone which we probably cannot answer nowŠis how members of the Parisian audience understood the figure of Lucky in 1953.  If Pozzo represented a cruel and demanding Nazi, who did Lucky represent?  Was he a Jew, a prisoner of a Concentration Camp, or was he a Parisian during the Occupation?  We do know that Beckett™s potentially generic master-slave pair was rendered and read in Paris as a reference to the collective trauma of Parisians at the time.  And, further, the performance of Pozzo as a Nazi indicated the perpetrator of the trauma.   78Beckett was part of this ﬁcollectiveﬂ in Paris after the war.  When he returned to Paris after years of interminable waiting, Beckett found his beloved city and his relationships with friends and colleagues irrevocably changed by the war (Bair 1978: 373).  As a text, Waiting for Godot was born out of Beckett™s personal trauma and the mood of collective trauma in Paris following the war.  However, as discussed previously, Beckett explicitly includes neither the war nor any other referent in his play.  In addition to lacking a referent, literary scholars have argued that Beckett revolutionized the narrative logic of drama.  As I discussed previously, Godot resists standard plot progression; the play presents an experience of waiting and time rather than being ﬁaboutﬂ anything.  Godot™s arrival, what is expected to ﬁhappenﬂ in a standard sense, is denied to the characters and the audience.  However, from the first performance, audiences and directors undermined Beckett™s intentions to stage a ﬁmeaninglessﬂ play defying definitions and interpretation.  Against the grain of Beckett™s narrative logic, audiences and producers insert meanings into the play by specifying victims, perpetrators, and the nature of their trauma.  The central contribution of cultural trauma is the insistence that occurrences are not automatically traumatic; events must become traumatic.  Groups must construct and narrate events and their aftermath as threatening or damaging to the meaning structures which underpin, and indeed constitute, the collective.  Individuals and groups construct and contest the meaning of events in institutions such as courts, parliaments and the media (Alexander 2004: 15-20).  The media play a crucial role as journalists and intellectuals report and interpret the construction and contestation of trauma narratives in other institutional realms.  In addition to reporting strict ﬁfactsﬂ such as numbers of the dead, the cost of destruction, and the transcripts of judicial and legislative hearings, journalists and writers may ﬁexpressively dramatizeﬂ traumas in the mass media (Alexander 2004: 18).    79The capacity of the media to convey, interpret, and judge constructions and narrations of trauma is critical in the social performance of Waiting for Godot in Sarajevo and New Orleans.  The media constitutes an audience to the social performance along with the audience which was physically present at the performances of the play in those cities.  Valentin Rauer argues that the presence of multiple layers of audience is an essential feature of social performance (2006: 260).  Social performances require actors to creatively perform and audiences to interpret the performance.  Further, the audience does not consist only in Goffman™s dichotomous front stage and back stage (2006: 259).  In societies with mass media, there are layers of audiences who witness, describe, interpret, and judge social performances: there is an in-person audience, the media audience that encodes the performance, and the media consumers who hear or read about their reports (Rauer 2006: 260).   Rauer identifies these three layers of audience in his case study of the performative act of German Chancellor Willy Brandt™s kniefall at the monument to those who suffered and died in the Warsaw Ghetto (2006).  Rauer disaggregates the audience of social performance analytically to understand the different ways audiences contribute to the social performance or diffuse it through their actions and interpretations.  In other words, social performance requires fusion with all layers of audience to become a salient performance.  However, Rauer does not discuss the ability of social actors to shape how the audience, including the journalistic audience, receives and perceives the social performance.  Using Rauer™s three layers of audience is useful for analyzing the interpretations of meaning by the various audiences for the productions of Waiting for Godot.  Further, I will show that analytically disaggregating the layers of audience illuminates different performative strategies of the social actors who produced and directed Waiting for Godot in Sarajevo and New Orleans.  80The first-order audience consists of the spectators who are present for the performance (Rauer 260).  Social performances always entail action rather than description, and an audience, usually one that is physically present, must witness the act (Rauer 2006: 259).  The in-person audience reacts in real time to an action happening in their physical space.  Journalists and critics, the second-order audience, must report and interpret an occurrence for it to achieve social and cultural importance, for an occurrence to become a salient social event (Mast 2006: 118).  There is often overlap in the layers of audience (Rauer 2006: 260); indeed, some of the journalists who reported on the productions of Waiting for Godot in New Orleans and in Sarajevo physically attended a performance.  Journalists report on the performative act, recounting what happened and by whom.  Journalists and critics also encode the meaning of the event, interpreting the actions and declaring their consequence.  Journalists and critics pronounce a performance a ﬁsuccessﬂ or a ﬁfailure.ﬂ  A social performance is a ﬁsuccessﬂ on a theoretical level when the audience, the mise-en-scene, script, and the actors achieve ﬁre-fusionﬂ (Alexander 2006)  To achieve re-fusion, a social performance must be perceived as spontaneous rather than calculated, authentic not manufactured (Rauer 2006: 275).  Journalists and critics indicate the success or failure of a performance using these criteria, and by citing and interpreting the reactions of the in-person audience.  When the reactionsŠlaughter, gasps, comments, silence, and tearsŠof the first-order audience are encoded and conveyed by journalists, those who are present are simultaneously audience and actors in the social performance (Rauer 2006: 260).    Journalists and critics encode the meanings of the performance for the third-order audience, media consumers.  The third-order audience reads reports in newspapers and blogs, hears about the performance on the radio, and sees visual representations of it on television and the internet.  An occurrence becomes an event, and action becomes social performance, in part  81through the sheer dissemination to a wide third-order audience.  The third-order audience ﬁmore or less dependﬂ upon the interpretations of the journalists and critics and their assessment of performative success or failure (Rauer 2006: 260).  However, the third-order audience is not populated by passive consumers; they will also interpret the meaning of the performance and form their own opinions of its authenticity and consequence.  Nevertheless, their reactions are notoriously difficult for social analysts to capture.  It is the meanings as they are actively received by the third-order audience that they will mobilize in future decisions and actions such as in opinion polls and political action.       In Sarajevo during the siege and in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina social actorsŠdirectors, producers, and stage actorsŠappealed to all three layers of audience in their social performance of trauma through the theatrical production of Beckett™s Waiting for Godot.  In these locations, the play expresses the mood of collective trauma in Erickson™s sense.  However, the metaphor of waiting does not speak for itself.  The social actors make claims to trauma by inserting references to the nature of the trauma, the vicitims, and the perpetrators into Beckett™s referent-free avant-garde play.  These references specify and construct the trauma for the individuals who are living through the traumatic occurrence as well for the wider public from whom those claiming trauma seek recognition and solidarity.    Sarajevo   Susan Sontag, the American writer and public intellectual, traveled to Sarajevo in 1993 to direct Waiting for Godot as the city™s residents were being ravaged by indiscriminate violence, power outages, and widespread hunger.  Sontag™s production featured a local producer, Haris Pasovic, and local theater actors.  Sontag appealed to three layers of audience through her performative project: those who attended the performances in the Youth Theater in Sarajevo in  82August 1993, the journalists who wrote about the production, and the individuals who heard and read those accounts.  The production made claims to trauma through the production of the play that resonated and appealed to each level.  I will discuss how Sontag and the other social actors involved in the production appealed to each layer of audience and the ways in which the play achieved, or was said to achieve, re-fusion.  Of course there was overlap in strategies of appealing to and interpretation by the layers of audience: what the production of Waiting for Godot meant, or was said to mean, to the people of Sarajevo affects what it means, or what it is said to mean, to the audiences beyond the city. 
 How was the production of Godot experienced and interpreted by the people in Sarajevo during the summer of 1993?  To analyze the first-order audience almost two decades after the performance without having been present at the performance, I must rely on the accounts of the social actor™s involved: principally what Sontag wrote about her production and on comments by residents of Sarajevo as they are quoted by journalists.  Artistic culture, European identity, and feeling abandoned by their fellow Europeans were very much related for residents of Sarajevo in the summer of 1993.  Sarajevo™s residents who had sustained a vibrant intellectual and cultural life based in European artistic traditions were now living without electricity or proper food and were in constant fear for their lives.  Many of them felt that their European neighbors allowed them to suffer by their reticence to intervene in the violence.  Under ongoing attack, residents bitterly recognized that cultural solidarity with Europe did not extend to political solidarity.  The intellectuals and artists with whom many residents of the city felt an affiliation largely abandoned the cause of the Sarajevans.  Boujan Zec, a Sarajevan journalist, was quoted in The Guardian: ﬁWriters like Hemingway risked their lives for liberty in Spain. Now all that Europe  83can do is send us a few packets of aid.ﬂ69  By participating in the production of Godot, the actors, theater support staff, and first-order audience members reinforced for themselves their collective identity as civil, cultured Europeans worthy of being saved from ﬁsavageﬂ violence.  The actor Velibor Topic, who played one of the Estragons, was also quoted in The Guardian: ﬁThere is not only fighting on the front line. We must tell the world that we are not animals. We are cultured, we have ideas and dreams.ﬂ70  The production of Waiting for Godot and the media attention it generated was a way to showcase that culture and civility persevered in Sarajevo.  As Velibor indicates, the production of Waiting for Godot, a well-known and respected play, articulated their collective identity as civilized Europeans to the residents of Sarajevo. The production was intended to articulate the same collective identity to audiences outside the city.    The residents of Sarajevo were also widely quoted by journalists and by Sontag saying that Waiting for Godot made sense to perform in their historical moment because they, too, were waiting.  They were waiting for in intervention by the United States, President Clinton, the United Nations, and their European neighbors.  John Pomfret includes one of the actor™s reflections on the figure of Godot in his article for the Washington Post: ﬁYou never know when something is going to come crashing down and blow your head apart–  That's my own personal Godot.ﬂ71  Using the same sort of language as the academic David Bradby when he identified Godot™s ﬁspecial relevance,ﬂ a British reporter writes, ﬁThe play's message has touched a chord among Sarajevans beyond the tiny theatre-going public. ‚I hear Ms Sontag is waiting for Godot - we are are waiting for the Europeans and the Americans,™ commented Jovan Divjak, a Bosnian                                                  69 Narayan, Natasha. 1993. ﬁA Candle in the Dark.ﬂ The Guardian, August 20, p. 2.  70 Narayan. 1993.

The journalists and critics, including Sontag herself, who wrote about the production of Godot in Sarajevo largely focused on the desperation in Sarajevo and how apt the metaphor of waiting was for the residents™ situation.  Soon after returning to the United States in the early fall of 1993, Sontag wrote two similar essays about her experience directing the play in the beleaguered city.  Published in the New York Review of Books and the Performing Arts Journal, Sontag targeted her reflections and interpretations of the performance to an elite, intellectual, and largely American audience.  In ﬁWaiting for Godot in Sarajevo,ﬂ Sontag wrote that she traveled to Sarajevo to direct a production of Waiting for Godot in order to ﬁpitch in and do somethingﬂ (1994: 87).  Although Sontag insisted that she could not go to Sarajevo merely to act as a witness to the violence, she is that too.  In her essay, she provides details about life in the city that read like an ethnographic account.  Sontag describes the emotional tableau of collective trauma, stringing together observations that echo Erikson™s fieldwork in Buffalo Creek:    –many Sarajevans are reluctant to leave their apartments except when it is absolutely necessary–though no one is safe anywhere, they have more fear when they are in the street.  And beyond fear, there is depressionŠmost Sarajevans are very depressedŠwhich produces lethargy, exhaustion, apathy. (1994:90)     
 Further, Sontag reports that the residents are ﬁwaiting, hoping, not wanting to hope,ﬂ and they are ﬁhumiliatedﬂ (1994: 91).  The forces promoting what Erikson called the ﬁprevailing mood and temperﬂ of collective trauma were constant; the real danger had not subsided in Sarajevo.  Snipers threatened to kill people on the street and in their homes.  Residents lacked electricity,                                                  72 Tanner, Marcus. 1993. ﬁA Long Wait for Godot.ﬂ The Independent, August 2, p. 1.    85and waited in lines to receive daily rations of food and water from the United Nations.  Sontag notes that her actors suffered from fatigue and malnutrition; a formerly overweight actress lost more than sixty pounds during the war.  The newspaper accounts of the situation in Sarajevo and of the plight of the individuals in the social and professional circle of the theater mention many of the same details that Sontag includes in her essays.      The second-order audience, the journalists, established that Godot was, in fact, an apt metaphor in large part by describing the reactions of the actors and the audience in the theater.  Many journalists describe what happened and interpret the mood in Youth Theater during the performances by mentioning particular details such as what materials appeared on stage, what the actors wore, and how the house was lit.  I quote John Burns of the New York Times:  A charged silence settled over the theater as actors and audience took a long, painful pause, digesting a message of hope deceived that is a defining passage of a new dramatic production performed here for the first time on Tuesday.  To hear the silence of the 
packed house in the small theater in the city center was to feel the grief and disappointment that weigh on Sarajevo as it nears the end of its second summer under siege.73    
 
By declaring a match between the situation ﬁon the groundﬂ and the play using the stunned, silent, pensive, and emotional reaction of the in-person audience as evidence, the journalists declared Waiting for Godot a performative ﬁsuccess.ﬂ  The journalists indicated to their reading and listening audience that Godot re-fused the setting, script, audience, and actors into a shared experience of meaning.  They conveyed that everyone in Sarajevo understand exactly what Godot meant and why it was important to perform in Sarajevo at that moment.  And, importantly, during the performance of the play, performed around the world so many times before, the Sarajevan audience saw not only a classic dramatic work; they saw themselves.         86 The journalists and critics who described and interpreted the production of Waiting for Godot conveyed to their listening and reading audience how apt the metaphor was for waiting, uncertainty, and anxiety in Sarajevo.  Many journalists repeated variations on the statement ﬁThe metaphor of waiting for intervention was well understood.ﬂ74  Often, they established the resonance of Godot by describing that the in-person audience was riveted by the performance, collectively understanding its significance in their place and time.  However, Beckett™s script and the metaphor of waiting did not speak unaided for the trauma of the Sarajevans.  Sontag and the actors changed significant elements of Beckett™s play including the set, the characters, and the length of the play to signify their circumstance and to narrate their trauma for the audience beyond the besieged city.  Such changes would be notable in almost any dramatic performance, but insertions into the play to establish the meaning of the situation is additionally surprising in Godot.  Beckett and his estate are (in)famously inflexible, rarely allowing productions to deviate from Beckett™s authorial intentions for the staging of his plays.75  More importantly for this study, by specifying the nature and players in a trauma the social actors insert a referent into a play that does not carry one of its own.  Instead of one pair of protagonists, Sontag staged three pairs of Vladimirs and Estragons as ﬁthree variations on the theme of the coupleﬂ with one mixed gender, one male, and one female couple.  She reports she made the decision, at least in part, to ﬁemployﬂŠa symbolic rather than monetary conceptŠmore actors (1994: 92).  However, a journalist quotes her explaining to her actors: ﬁBeckett was still thinking in that old way of thinking; that if these                                                                                                                                                              73 Burns, John F. 1993. ﬁTo Sarajevo, Writer Brings Good Will and ‚Godot.™ﬂ The New York Times, August 19.   74 Narayan. 1993. The Guardian, August 20. 75 See, for example, 1993. ﬁWaiting for Godette.ﬂ The Times, September 1, Features. This news piece states that Sontag™s ﬁreal accomplishmentﬂ is staging Godot with female actresses while the Beckett estate sues other productions for the same substitution.     87characters are to be representative then they should be men.ﬂ76  In addition to lightening the burden on her exhausted and malnourished actors, Sontag explains that the extra pairs of travelers have the symbolic value of representing both men and women, male and female Sarajevans who wait for Godot alike and together.  Pomfret, writing for The Washington Post, declares: ﬁThis troika succeeds on the stage as each pair -- two women, two men, and a man and a woman -- explore different parts of the waiting game as they inhabit a world garnished with ammo boxes, sandbags and a hospital bed -- part of the spiritual architecture of life in Sarajevo.ﬂ77  Here, in addition to declaring the representation of all Sarajevans a success, Pomfret also indicates that the production introduced meanings of trauma into the set of Godot which is usually exceedingly sparce.  David Bradby argues that the most important aspect of the 
setting of Godot is its ﬁneutrality: it provides an empty space, neither historically conditioned nor socially appropriatedﬂ (2001: 34).  However, Sontag™s actors presented Waiting for Godot ﬁon a stage lit by candles, and with Red Cross boxes and UN sandbags as props–ﬂ78  In one of her nods to Beckett in her essay, Sontag comments that her staging was ﬁas minimally furnished, I thought, as Beckett himself could have desiredﬂ (1994: 96).  She fails to mention the war paraphernalia invoking the Red Cross and The United Nations, material representations of trauma, decorating the stage.   
  Sontag only staged the first act of the play.  In her essay on the production, she points out that the first act is ﬁitself a complete playﬂ without the repetition and the stasis of the second act (1994: 97).  She reports that she decided to stage only the first half of the play because her actors and audience could not sustain energy for a longer performance.  However, Sontag undermined                                                  76 Eagar, Charlotte. 1993. ﬁRadical-Chic Sontag Waits for Godot as Shells Shake Theatre of the Absurd.ﬂ The Observer, July 25, p. 13.   77 Pomfret. 1993. The Washington Post, August 19.    88her explanation of this as a logistical, value-free decision in comments to the first- and second-order audiences.  Pomfret attended a performance in Sarajevo where Sontag announced:  ﬁIts correct title, then, is ‚Waiting for Godot: Act 1.™  We are all waiting for Act 2.ﬂ79  Of course, Beckett™s Godot never arrives.  Sontag™s Godot may still arrive in the Act 2 that is yet to unfold.  Until he arrivesŠand perhaps even if he doesŠhe is a guilty party in their trauma.   
 So far, it sounds very much like all the journalists agree that Waiting for Godot was the right play at the right time in Sarajevo and that the residents of Sarajevo responded to this resonance and relevance.  This is, actually, largely true.  But that is not to say that there were no criticisms of staging Godot in Sarajevo.  The criticisms, however, did not pertain to whether or not the claims made implicitly and explicitly through the playŠthat the Sarajevans suffer from deep existential uncertainty and physical decline as they wait for the United States, the United Nations, and their European neighbors to intervene in the violence.  Rather, whether or not the play will be taken as a legitimate, successful social performance of trauma hinges on whether the performance was spontaneous and authentic.  Specifically, the motivations and actions of Susan Sontag coming to the beleaguered city to direct the play was at issue for the layers of audiences.  Simply stated, the critical question is not whether the meanings encoded by the performance are correct; the critical question is whether Sontag should have directed the play.   The most direct and vehement critic, Richard Grenier, wrote that Sontag has resumed her ﬁher position as the artist-moralist of the Western worldﬂ in the ﬁlimelightﬂ of Sarajevo.80  Grenier™s was the most ardent formulation of what occurred in whispers in other news pieces: did Sontag seek out this high-profile cause to boost her own career or did she seek to bring the                                                                                                                                                              78 William, David. 1993. ﬁThe Great Provider: Alemko Has it all at a Price Despite the Siege.ﬂ The Daily Mail, August 18, p. 12.  79 Pomfret. 1993.

E3.   89world™s attention to the situation in Sarajevo?  Is it legitimate for an intellectual from the U.S. to travel to a war zone to direct a play?  Although these questions were certainly not uniformly answered or resolved, many reporters™ accounts assure the third-order audience that Sontag™s presence and her work in the embattled Sarajevo theater scene were welcome by the Sarajevans.  
An editor of a Sarajevo newspaper that continued to publish during the shelling, Kemal Kurspahic, commented on the status of Sontag: ﬁShe is not a war tourist–She has really tried to come here and talk to us and understand the situation.ﬂ81  The same news story states, as do several other reports, that Sontag declines, out of a sense of equality and solidarity, to wear her flak jacket.  Some reporters write that a flak jacket lies nearby the famous intellectual, but, like her actors, she goes without.  Weighing in on her authenticity as an artist in Sarajevo, Sontag tells a reporter, ﬁYou have to have some reason to be here. I'm not just a voyeur. I was invited to take part in a theatre festival–ﬂ82  Journalists and critics declared Sontag™s production of Waiting for Godot a performative success.  The meanings resonated with the situation and the people.  Sontag™s changes to Beckett™s stage directions were not over-done and those embellishments did not take away from the power of the play™s simplicity.  Sontag™s position and job as director were (largely) authentic and the show™s connection with the audience seemed spontaneous and strong.  In short, most journalists declared Waiting for Godot a successful social performance in Sarajevo.        New Orleans       Graphic and performance artist Paul Chan knew about Sontag™s production of Waiting for Godot in Sarajevo when he brought a production of Beckett™s play to New Orleans in November 2007.  Chan considers his production of Godot ﬁwithin the lineage of imagining what it means to                                                  81 Narayan. 1993 The Guardian, August 20.  90create art in places where we ought not to have anyﬂ which includes Sontag™s production. 83  Supported by the public art nonprofit Creative Time, Chan mounted a multifaceted expressive project featuring a whispering campaign and local art practices including Second line brass bands.  Like Sontag™s production in Sarajevo, Chan dramatizes and communicates the situation of the people living in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina to the city™s residents and to the wider world.  And like Sontag™s production, Chan and the director Christopher McElroen and the stage actors added specific references to their city and their situation to Beckett™s austere drama.  In a sense, Chan had at his disposal Beckett™s script for the play as well as a script written by Sontag™s production, the production at San Quentin, in South Africa and elsewhere for how to stage Waiting for Godot as a metaphor for trauma.  In these instances, though the play is touted as a ﬁperfectﬂ and ﬁaptﬂ metaphor, the nature of the trauma, the perpetrators, and the victims are explicitly referenced via the characters, set, costumes, and other theatrical elements.  The second ﬁscriptﬂ of Godot as a social performance of trauma indicates what can be altered in Beckett™s play to make it speak for and construct the trauma at hand.  Journalists comment on this ﬁlineageﬂ and how Chan uses the script passed down to him from Sontag, the prison productions, 
and others.84  Also like the production in Sarajevo, in addition to expressive aptness which is required for the play to express and narrate trauma, the legitimacy of artists who direct and produce the play are at issue for residents and journalists.   Chan™s production went beyond Beckett™s script and the previous productions from his ﬁlineageﬂ to mount a social performance of community and trauma.  To advertise the performances, Chan and his theater group posted signs including only Beckett™s first stage                                                                                                                                                              82 Narayan. 1993 The Guardian, August 20. 83 Simon, Scott. 2007. ﬁStill Waiting on Repairs, New Orleans Hosts ‚Godot.™ﬂ Weekend Edition Saturday, National Public Radio, November 3.   91directions: ﬁA country road.

Before the show went up, the producer and others involved with the production hosted theater workshops and attended pot-luck dinners with a variety of New Orleans residents.  The Times-Picayune™s coverage of this multifaceted art project helped to send out a casting call for local actors to audition for the play.87  Chan cast three actors from the Classical Theater of Harlem production of Waiting for Godot, including Wendell Pierce who plays Detective Moreland on the popular television show The Wire and is a native son of New Orleans.  Chan cast a local actor, Mark McLaughlin, as Lucky, and two young local actors shared the role of the Boy.88  The local paper also listed phone numbers to call for reservations for the show and issued a call for volunteers to help with various aspects of the production.89  The Times-Picayune advertised that at each of the free performances the audience would share a gumbo dinner before being led into the seating area by Second line bands.90 The play was performed at a street corner in the Lower Ninth Ward and in front of a destroyed house in Gentilly.  In his artist statement, Chan explains that staging the play outside with the brass band ﬁconnects with the city™s storied tradition of street performance, from Mardi Gras to the Second lines that leisurely snake through streets and                                                                                                                                                              84 Simon. 2007.

On the day of the first performance, the Times-Picayune quoted Pierce exclaiming with a laugh, ﬁWe're gonna have a lot of New Orleans in this!ﬂ93  The local flavor surrounding the stage performance expresses to residents and to thoseoutside the city that New Orleans has a unique and vibrant culture that should not languish or  disapped e apt se xt  at     ar.

When Estragon sat on a curb on the stage, the woman remarked, ﬁHe's sitting thenth re like me sitting on my stoop.ﬂ96  Beckett™s characters and the characthe oney Green who  for                                                 ers in the drama of Katrina wait just the same, sitting on the stoop and watching up troad for Godot to arrive.   Like the woman in the Ninth Ward who sits on her stoop, several articles about the production of Godot convey that the characters in this social performance have their own experiences of waiting like Beckett™s hobos, the stage characters.  McLaughlin, who plays Lucky, told a reporter for the Times-Picayune, ﬁI see this 'Godot' every single day on my block, where a Baptist church is a clearinghouse for all kinds of people in need.ﬂ97  An article in the Times-Picayune divulges that Pierce, the famous television and movie actor, is angry about his parents™ experiences tangling with government bureaucracy and ﬁpoliticsﬂ to get recovery mafter losing their home during Katrina.

The stage actors bring Beckett™s characters to life on stage, andthey are bringing Green™s story to life as well.           In Sarajevo, Godot was performed concurrently with the violent siege; in New Orlemore than two years elapsed between the storm and the production of Godot.  Through the multi-faceted social performance, the Waiting for Godot production and project in New Orleans articulated that the people in New Orleans continue to wait for the disaster, and the trauma, to end.  One way that the production articulated the residents of New Orleans as ﬁvictimsﬂ was by casting a mix of African-American and local actors.  The Lower Ninth Ward and Gentilly are predominantly black neighborhoods.  Flooding in the city and the miserably slow response frothe local, state, and federal governments disproportionately affected black neighborhoodblack residents.  By casting Beckett™s travelers to ﬁlook likeﬂ the people in New Orleans, the production represented the identity of those who are the victims of an ongoing trauma.   We can also think about the production of Waiting for Godot and the other aspects of the art project as a counter-performance to the rhetoric and placations that politicians have offerethe residents of New Orleans.

The counter-performance of the Waiting for Godot artistic project expresses  the macy ctors unity made                                                 and articulates their continuing trauma: the residents of the Lower Ninth Ward and Gentilly are still waiting, uncertain of their fate and abandoned by Godot.    The second-order audience, the journalists, and the residents they interview claim thatplay represents the situation of the people of the Crescent City.  Like Beckett™s hobos, they wait for an object of desire which they only know in a hazy form.  Who is Godot?  When is relief coming?  When will the city return to ﬁnormalﬂ?  There is no dispute in any of the newspaper or television reports, local or national, which I surveyed that Beckett™s play uniquely represents life in New Orleans.  Like in Sarajevo, questions about the legitimacy of the play, and the legitiof the social performance carried on through and around it, focus on the producers and direwho came to New Orleans from outside the city.  Can artists legitimately create a claim to someone else™s trauma?  We learn from the productions of Godot in Sarajevo and in New Orleans that they may if they properly engage the local population by hiring them as actors, costumers, and stage hands.  Chan goes beyond this to partner with various community groups; two separate articles in the Times-Picayune and an article in The New York Times list a long roster of local partners in the Godot project including high schools, universities, and commorganizations.101  Writing for the Times-Picayune, MacCash and Cuthbert write that Chan New Orleans his ﬁtemporary homeﬂ for the duration of the Godot project. 102   He™s not an insider, of course, but they convey that he is not merely a tourist-artist cashing in on New Orleans™s misfortunes either.

Of course, they may be.  Political leaders deliver speeches to assign guilt and to argue for the veracity of thclaims to trauma.

Through fact-oriented speech and action, social indict a party as guilty or refuse blame.  Other claims to trauma reveal.  Through expressive performance, social actors represent the elements of trauma.  Truth and Reconciliation Commissions, though surely performative in some senses (cite Tanya Goodman?), appeal to factual and experiential truth.  Participants formally state where they were, what happened tothem, and by whom.  Victims name perpetrators and their crimes.  In contrast, through the case study of Waiting for Godot, I argue that social performance of trauma appeals to expressivetruth.

Journalists, critics, and academics declare that Waiting for Godot is a metaphor for these situations.  The set is a metaphor for the bleakness of landscape following a disaster; waiting forGodot is a metaphor for waiting these situations to end.  However, even the most apt metaphordo not speak for themselves.  I challenge the notion that the play simply stands for the situation of trauma.  Instead, I show that social actors inject the play with meanings in order to express their situation as a trauma.  Yet, to speak too explicitly of blame and the status of victims turns metaphor into bald politics.  If made explicit, claims to guilt and innocence may be acceptedrejected on the grounds of truth claims.  Like so many paintings (Picaso™s Guernica is perhaps the most famous example) and films (Roots for Godot narrates the trauma and expresses charges of guilt without making accusations in the political realm or a court of justice.

Instead, the audiences to these  The Times-Picayune, November 10.    98productions of Waiting for Godot pronounced the performances a success or failure based on taptness of the expression for capturing the experiences of the residents in each city.  This is not only a separate rubric from other claims to trauma, but of course a different rubric of succethan most theatrical performances.  The acting, directing, costuming, and stage design wbased exclusively on the logic of the theater, but also on the logic of social performance.  Audiences expected the actors to embody Vladimir and Estragon, sure, but there was a simultaneous expectation that they personify the residents of the cities as well.  Audiences did not only appreciate Godot as a literary masterpiece but as the representation of their plight.

The success of the social performance is judged in part on the aptness of the play.  Is it too intellectual?  Is it too dark?  Is the play overdone?

 Center for Cultural Sociology Trauma Workshop June 15-16, 2009 Athens The drama of the Greek civil war trauma  Nicolas Demertzis ndemert@media.uoa.gr 
 Yale University           semi-final draft 103 Preface 
 Child of a working class family, I was born in late 1950s. Less than a year before my birth, my family had to move to Athens, the capital of Greece, where ever since 1950 dozens of thousands of inner immigrants have been moving in. Abandoning their home villages for a better life, all these people had to sort out the new urban setting with limited material resources and social capital. So did my family; they had to adjust themselves into an unfamiliar social environment whose promise for upward mobility required much emotional energy and human cost. During my childhood I was occasionally witnessing quarrels between my parents and my ten years eldest brother over family issues mainly related to the coping with the harsh conditions of our everyday life. What was striking me, or what I currently think it was striking me, in those quarrels, particularly whenever carrier and life chances were involved, was my brother addressing fervently my father using the biblical saying the sins of the fathers visit upon their children. Upon this utterance I remember my farther remaining speechless, with his facial expression revealing embarrassment and a hidden desperation and then suddenly every discussion was over. 
For many years I was at odds with these repeated episodes because I couldn™t understand or 
imagine what the sins of my beloved father might be, and how was it ever possible for that hard working and honest man to commit any sin at all. Insinuations and silence on this didn™t help much until my adolescence where I started to realize the meaning of the words ‚occupation™, 
‚resistance™, ‚resistance fighter™, and ‚exile™ which were mentioned by both my parents rarely in the house. As soon as I realized that the meaning of those words was somehow about my father, I came to feel that there was actually no puzzle of a wrongdoing, no sin committed. On the contrary, although he was a resistance fighter he was sent to a detention camp shortly after the liberation from the Axis. While I was growing up, through my parental identifications and despite the fact that my father was hardly speaking about his past political doings and about politics in general, I found it unjust; in time, around this sense of injustice I discovered myself to almost naturally belonging to the community of the Greek Left, whatever the vagueness of the word might be. Nonetheless, the embarrassment at his face and the silence related to that biblical saying, which sounded like a verdict, were a bit of an unsettled reminder in my mind, a bit of a mystery.  At his 60s, when I was already a young man, he was ready to become somewhat more talkative about his experiences during the 1940s. Among others, I recall two things: first, he was emphatically saying that he ‚did no harm to anyone™ while in the resistance; second, he was describing the civil war as a big mistake and a drama. Then it didn™t escape my notice that although he did not take part in the civil war in any conceivable way he was sharing the responsibility for this ‚big mistake™. He was feeling guilty and humiliated and therefore he kept silent most of the time. Though he committed no wrongdoing he was feeling guilty because he identified himself with the defeated Left as a whole, as a declined imaginary community. The mystery was almost solved. My father™s state of mind reflected the mentality of an entire generation; the generation of the civil war whose experiences and memories were so much complicated, emotionally charged, and negatively marked that were condemned into silence, embarrassment and fear. Those experiences and memories spill over the next generation precisely because the Greek civil war 
was not just a personal drama for all those who took active part in it but a cultural trauma which was meant to affect the entire social body and the body polity for several decades. In this paper I  104
